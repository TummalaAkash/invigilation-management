# 🎓 Invigilation Management System

This project was developed to solve a real problem faced by our university's exam cell during the assignment of invigilation duties. Manual allocation of duties often led to confusion, especially when a faculty member was unavailable due to health issues or other responsibilities. Reassigning duties in such cases was time-consuming and inefficient.

## 💡 Problem Statement

The exam cell team at our university found it challenging to:
- Assign invigilation duties fairly and efficiently.
- Handle last-minute changes when faculty members were unavailable.
- Notify faculty members about their assigned duties promptly.

## ✅ Our Solution

We built an **Invigilation Management System** that automates the process of assigning invigilation duties and simplifies communication between faculty and the exam cell.

### 👨‍💼 Admin Workflow
- Admin logs in and creates an exam schedule.
- The system automatically assigns invigilation duties to available faculty members.
- Admin can view, update, or reassign duties if needed.

### 👩‍🏫 Faculty Workflow
- Faculty can log into their portal to view assigned duties.
- If they are unable to attend a duty, they can raise a **swap request** with the name of an available faculty.
- Admin reviews and approves the request; if approved, the duty is reassigned to the new faculty and records are updated automatically.

## 🔧 Key Features
- Auto-assignment of invigilators.
- Real-time faculty notification system.
- Duty swap request and approval process.
- Admin control panel to manage schedules and allocations.
